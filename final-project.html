                <h1>‚è∞Time Management</h1>
                <p>Time management can be really difficult now-a-days, it's really difficult to balance between all the
                    different things you need to do and sometimes we can find ourselves getting overwhelmed with all the
                    things we have to get done we lose sight of what's important. Connecting with God, and playing
                    Minecraft.</p>
                <h1>üåøSelf Care</h1>
                <p>Part of time management is learning when to slow down. Taking care of your mental, emotional, and
                    physical well-being
                    isn't selfish, it's necessary. Whether it's taking a walk, journaling, or just stepping away from
                    the
                    screen, making time
                    to recharge helps you show up better in every other area of life.</p>

                    <h2>My Method</h2>
                    <p>I find it really difficult to find time for everything I'd like to do. I have found a lot of
                        peace in
                        choosing to try and put God first, make sure I give Him a piece of my time before anything
                        else,
                        After that, it's all about using my time wisely and avoiding distractions. Here are a few simple
                        habits that help me
                        stay balanced.</p>

                    <div class="tips">
                        <h2>Give God Time First</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes it can be tempting to put off scripture study. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tips">
                        <h2>Plan Your Week</h2>
                        <p>I like to set aside time on Sunday to look at my week. It helps me stay focused and prevents
                            surprises. Find a routine
                            that works for you and stick with it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tips">
                        <h2>Don't get stuck!</h2>
                        <p>It's easy to lose time on things that don't really matter. Notice when you're stuck ‚Äî and
                            move on. Even 10 minutes saved
                            here and there adds up.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tips">
                        <h2>Social media time limits!</h2>
                        <p>I set a 30-minute daily limit on social media. It's just enough to check in, without getting
                            lost. Boundaries help you
                            make room for better things.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tips">
                        <h2>If you're tired, get up earlier!</h2>
                        <p>I know this sounds backwards ‚Äî but waking up earlier (even after a short night) sometimes
                            helps me reset and get more
                            from my day. Try it a few times and see what works for you.</p>
