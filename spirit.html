                <h1>Spiritual Balance ‚öñÔ∏è</h1>
                <p>Some gamers, students, or just individuals in general might wonder why it's important to
                    prioritize spiritual balance. In my experience it's been monumental to my success to make sure
                    that I put God first, and balance my work / school / relationship life with my spiritual life.
                    There truly is a living spirit that's a part of you, and when starved, the consequences can be
                    substantial. Take care of your spiritual self and God will help you with the rest of your
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <h1>üí™ If He Can Do It, You Can Do It</h1>
                <p>The Savior Jesus Christ lived a very busy life, full of service, teaching, healing, but somehow,
                    He was always able to find time to speak to His Father. I imagine it could have been easy for
                    Jesus to say, or for us to say, "He understands I'm busy" or maybe "He knows I love Him".
                    Falling into this dangerous mindset can cut us off spiritually from the one person, our Father
                    in Heaven, who wants us to succeed in all things. The Person who has access to infinite
                    resources to help you accomplish your goals. </p>
